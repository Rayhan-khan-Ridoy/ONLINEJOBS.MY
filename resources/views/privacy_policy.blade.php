                  <div class="t11" style="width:80%"> <b>Introduction</b> <br><br> This Cookie Policy ("Policy") explains that we
                    believe in being open and clear about how we use your information. In the spirit of transparency, this Policy
                    provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies on our Websites. This cookie policy applies to any
                    onlinejobs.my product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. <br><br> <b>a. Does
                      onlinejobs.my uses cookies?</b> <br><br> onlinejobs.my uses cookies, tags and other technologies when you use any of
                    the onlinejobs.my websites, mobile sites or mobile apps (collectively "the services"). Cookies are used to ensure
                    everyone has their best possible experience. Cookies also help us keep your account safe. By continuing to visit
                    or use our services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe
                    in this policy. If you prefer not to receive cookies or web beacons, then you should stop using our site, or
                    consult your browsing and third party cookie settings as described below. <br><br> <b>b. What is a cookie?</b>
                    <br><br> Cookies are small pieces of text stored by a website you visit in your browser and subsequently sent by
                    your web browser in every request to the website. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the Site
                    or a third-party to recognize you and make your next visit easier and the Site more useful to you. Essentially,
                    cookies are a user’s identification card for the onlinejobs.my servers. Cookies allow onlinejobs.my to serve you better
                    and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience on our site. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used in
                    the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness
                    and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may analyse or perform analysis based on the use
                    of these technologies and generate reports on an individual and aggregated basis. <br><br> Cookies can be
                    "persistent" or "session" cookies. A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier
                    to return to onlinejobs.my or interact with our services without signing in again. After you sign in, a persistent
                    cookie stays in your browser and will be read by onlinejobs.my when you return to one of our sites or a partner site
                    that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a
                    website or a browser session). <br><br> <b>c. What are cookies used for?</b> <br><br> When you visit our Websites,
                    we may place a number of cookies in your browser. These are known as First Party Cookies and are required to
                    enable to hold session information as you navigate from page to page within the website. For example, we use
                    cookies on our Websites to understand visitor and user preferences, improve their experience, and track and
                    analyse usage, navigational and other statistical information. Additionally, cookies allow us to bring you
                    advertising both on and off the onlinejobs.my site, and bring customized features to you. You can control the use of
                    cookies at the individual browser level. If you elect not to activate the cookie or to later disable cookies, you
                    may still visit our Websites, but your ability to use some features or areas of the Websites may be limited. We
                    may use any of the following categories of cookies on the Websites as detailed below. Each cookie falls within one
                    of the four following categories: <br><br>

                    identify you more quickly when you return. Cookies help us to determine which pages or information you find most
                    useful or interesting on our own websites.<br><br> onlinejobs.my may also have some cookies for its own analytics
                    i.e. analytics not part of Google Analytics. Such cookies help generate statistics and reports about visitors and
                    their activities on the website or app.<br><br> <b>e. How cookies are used for online analytics purposes?</b>
                    <br><br> We may use web analytics services on onlinejobs.my, such as those of Google Analytics. These services help
                    us analyse how users use the services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The
                    information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by such service providers, who
                    use the information to evaluate your use of the services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes
                    related to online marketing, as described in the following sections. <br><br> <b>f. How are cookies used for
                      advertising purposes?</b> <br><br> Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us
                    serve relevant ads to you more effectively. They also help us provide aggregated auditing, research, and reporting
                    for advertisers, understand and improve our service, and know when content has been shown to you. We work with
                    website analytics and advertising partners, including Google Display Network, Facebook, etc. to deliver onlinejobs.my
                    advertisements on third party publisher websites - these partners may set cookies on your computer's web browser.
                    These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you onlinejobs.my
                    advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and
                    interactions while using onlinejobs.my services. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, de-identified
                    information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you
                    interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent visits to onlinejobs.my websites and
                    applications. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
                    of most interest to you, and it allows onlinejobs.my to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the
                    usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that
                    have been shown using the Google Display Network, Facebook for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks.
                    By doing so, we can understand how anonymous users interacted with our website after seeing our ads. <br><br>

                    We also pull through content from social networks into our own pages, such as embedded Facebook feeds. The social
                    networks, such as Facebook, Google, etc. may themselves also put cookies on your machine. If a user logs into
                    Facebook, Twitter or Google+ via our website, they will leave a cookie on the users' computer. This is the same
                    process as if the user logs into these social networks directly. <br><br> We also use Google Analytics on our
                    Services to help us analyse how our Services are used. Google Analytics uses performance cookies to track
                    customer’s interactions. For example, by using cookies, Google can tell us which pages our users view, which are
                    most popular, what time of day our websites are visited, whether visitors have been to our websites before, what
                    website referred the visitor to our websites, and other similar information. All of this information is

                    targeting or advertising cookies in the preceding section , the list is not exhaustive and is subject to change.
                    Therefore, even if you choose to turn off all the third-party cookies listed in section , you may still receive
